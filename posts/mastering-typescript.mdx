# Mastering TypeScript

TypeScript has become an essential tool in modern web development. Let's dive into some advanced concepts and best practices.

## Type System Fundamentals

TypeScript's type system is both powerful and flexible. Here are some key concepts:

### Union Types

```typescript
type Status = "pending" | "completed" | "failed";

function handleStatus(status: Status) {
  switch (status) {
    case "pending":
      return "Loading...";
    case "completed":
      return "Success!";
    case "failed":
      return "Error occurred";
  }
}
```

### Generics

Generics allow you to write reusable, type-safe code:

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

const num = identity(42); // type is number
const str = identity("hello"); // type is string
```

## Advanced Features

### Mapped Types

```typescript
type Readonly<T> = {
  readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];
};

interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

type ReadonlyUser = Readonly<User>;
```

### Conditional Types

```typescript
type NonNullable<T> = T extends null | undefined ? never : T;
```

## Best Practices

1. Enable strict mode in your `tsconfig.json`
2. Use interfaces for object shapes
3. Leverage type inference when possible
4. Document complex types with JSDoc comments

## Conclusion

TypeScript is a powerful tool that can help you write more maintainable and error-free code. Keep practicing and exploring its features!
